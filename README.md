# Family-Trees---Simple-Crud
Using React Js, Express Js , Node Js, MySQL


I built a Family Tree CRUD application using Express.js, 
MySQL, Node.js for the back-end and React.js for the front-end. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete family members from the database. 
The style of the application is simple, but it fulfills the requirements of the task given. The front-end was built using React.js, which allows for dynamic rendering of the page without having to reload the entire page.
For the back-end, I used Express.js to handle routing and MySQL as the database management system. Node.js was used to power the back-end and to run the application.
Overall, this application demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack CRUD application using popular web technologies.
